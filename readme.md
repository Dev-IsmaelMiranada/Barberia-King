# My First Responsive Web Page (Barber√≠a King)
This is a simple responsive web page built using pure HTML and CSS. 
The primary goal of this project was to create a website that adapts and displays properly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
HTML: HyperText Markup Language was used to structure the content of the web page.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets were employed to define the presentation and layout of the page.

## Features
1.- Responsive Design: The web page is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Media queries were utilized to apply specific styles based on the device width.

2.- Navigation Bar: A navigation bar is included at the top of the page, allowing users to easily navigate to different sections of the website.

3.- Hero Section: The hero section is prominently displayed at the top of the page and contains a visually appealing image or text to grab the user's attention.

4.- Content Sections: Multiple content sections are present on the page, each with its own unique styling and layout. These sections can include text, images, and other multimedia elements.

5.-Footer: The page includes a footer section at the bottom, which can contain additional links, copyright information, or other relevant details.
